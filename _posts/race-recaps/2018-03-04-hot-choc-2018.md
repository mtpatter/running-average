This race was my worst one yet.  I was really sick and couldn't really breathe
so I had to keep stopping and blow my nose.  Gross.

### Race

I was happy at least to have finished even though I was sick.

My time was a sad 2:04:36 for a basically walking 13:22 pace.

Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 3,463 of 4,219 (top 82.1%)
* Gender: 2,410 of 3,050 (79.0%)
* Age/gender group: 390 of 487 (80.1%)

Interesting because I did better relatively than I did for the Dawg Dash.

### In short

Bad race for me, but good swag and chocolate.
