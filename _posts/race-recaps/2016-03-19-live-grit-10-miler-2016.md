This was the first event that I've raced more than once, and I knew after last year's
great race that I'd want to run it again.

### Race
This year there were 1,270 people who finished the 10 mile, 655
of whom were women (52%). I love this small CARA race.

The course runs up and down the lakefront trail from Montrose avenue beach
and over Cricket Hill.

Here is the active.com site for the [official race results](http://results.active.com/events/live-grit-lakefront-10-miler-and-5k/).

Last year I finished with a 10:48' pace and a time of 1:48:01.
This year I finished with a 10:15' pace and a time of 1:42:34.
I'll take it!

This put me at

* Overall: 937 of 1,270 (26.0% up from 20.7% last year)
* Gender: 414 of 655 (36.7% up from 29.3%)
* Age/gender group: 87 of 133 (34.6% up from 17.6%)

I am pretty slow in this race relative to the other fast CARA runners.
I also "leveled-up" in my age/gender group, so that bump is partially do that selection bias.

But I ran great negative splits for my best 10 mile run yet.
