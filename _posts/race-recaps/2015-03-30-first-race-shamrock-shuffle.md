The 2015 Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle 8k was my first race. 
It was just under 5 miles on the Sunday before the Chi-town Half 
Marathon, so it fit in pretty well with the Nike+ Running Coach
half marathon training schedule and was a good opportunity to go through the
race experience at an easier distance before the half.

### Swag

We picked up our race packets at the fitness expo Friday night before the
race.  The race registration cost 
was $50 (plus another $10 for parking at the McCormick expo).
Gear included a Nike dri-fit green short sleeved shirt and a "gaiter" scarf thing
(awesome).  The expo also had free Michelob Ultra beers.  We didn't stay too long,
but I signed up for several more races (got some good discount codes/coupons)
and grabbed some extra swag- highlights were 
Magnificent Mile sunglasses and a headband sweatband thing.

### Race
This year there were 22,877 people who finished the race, 12,847
of whom were women (56%). Given the large number of entrants, the race was 
organized into two waves with a 45 minute separation in start time.  
I had registered in the 11:30' pace corral (second wave) but decided 
to try and go for a 10:30' pace finish.

I finished with a 10:26' finish (10:34' ave) for a time of 52:29, right at my goal.
This put me at 

* Overall: 13,605 of 22,877 (40.5%); 
* Gender: 6,176 of 12,847 (51.9%); 
* Age/gender group: 1,752 of 3,060 (42.7%); 
* 5k split: 33:03 time (10:39' pace)



### After party
The weather held for the race but 
started to turn pretty ugly (cold and rainy with a little
bit of hail- got immediately sick with a cold afterwards), 
and so we didn't stay long at the post-race party. 
We did take advantage of our free Michelob Ultra beers and other snacks- 
Sun Chips, bananas, etc.
Best of the snacks were definitely the Home Run Inn pizza slices.
  


### In short
Really fun for a first race!  Was great to run through the streets of Chicago.  The
medal is more of a bottle opener on a lanyard (doesn't even have the year on it
so maybe they'll use them again next year), but I've already made good use of the
shirt and gaiter.  8k seems like a great distance to race (for me)- would do it
again but prefer a Saturday run to have a day to recover before the work week.
