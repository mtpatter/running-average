I love the Fleet Feet Soldier Field 10 Mile race.  It was one of my favorites last
year and a great one again this year.

### Race

I was shooting for at least 1:45, which wouldn't be my best 10 miler, but still
a good effort.  I finished just short with 1:45:54 and a pace of 10:35'.

Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 4,808 of 9,163 (47.5%)
* Gender: 2,242 of 5,282 (52.6%)
* Age/gender group: 448 of 933 (52.0%)
* 5 mile split: 52:14 (10:27' pace)
