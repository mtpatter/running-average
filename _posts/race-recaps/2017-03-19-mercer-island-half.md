The Mercer Island half was my first race after moving to Seattle.
The race course was really pretty.  Even though it was pretty windy and
hilly, I still managed to PR. Must have been residual fitness from the marathon.

### Race

I was shooting for a hopeful 2:15 finish but fell just short for 2:15:08.
Almost.


Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 1,006 of 1,370 (top 73.4%)
* Gender: 399 of 627 (63.6%)
* Age/gender group: 69 of 100 (69.0%)

These runners must have been really good because
I sucked compared to most everyone else.  Still a PR.

### In short

Great day for a PR!  Would do over again in nice weather.
