I ran the Chicago Marathon - my first, and hopefully not my last, marathon.
This race was awesome!!  So many people out cheering and perfect weather.
Couldn't have asked for a better race.

### Race

My goal was to finish in 4:55, and I made it by one minute, finishing
at 4:53:59 with a pace of 11:13 min/mi.  So happy!


Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 26,847 of 40,523 (top 66.3%)
* Gender: 10,535 of 18,507 (56.9%)
* Age/gender group: 2,010 of 3,351 (60.0%)

So I sucked compared to most everyone else, but that's just fine with me.
