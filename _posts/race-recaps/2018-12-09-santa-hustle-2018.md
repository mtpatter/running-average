This race was great.  I had never done a fun run before.
It was my first 5k and my first race since moving to Indy.
I bought the Mrs. Claus package and got socks, arm warmers, and a tutu.

### Race

I did pretty poorly because I got sick again. 
I was hoping my first 5k would be a good race for me but maybe next time.

My time was a sad 37:01 for a 11:54 pace.  At least I got under 12'.

Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 505 of 1270 (top 39.8%)
* Gender: 311 of 903 (34.4%)
* Age/gender group: 40 of 93 (43.0%)

I think a lot of people must have walked because I didn't do that bad
compared to other people.

### In short

Lots of fun!  Will probably do next year (and hopefully better).
