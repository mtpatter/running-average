This was my first race after being sick all summer.  Didn't expect to do very
well, but at least I got out there.

### Race

This course was really weird.  I have no idea why they mapped it out this way.
Also, the 5k course merged at the end with the 10k, which was a horrible idea
because walkers and strollers and dogs all crowded the end of the course.

I finished with a sad 1:15:18 for a 12:07 pace.

Compared to the other runners, this put me at

* Overall: 1,036 of 1,133 (top 91.4%)
* Gender: 540 of 608 (88.8%)
* Age/gender group: 165 of 185 (89.2%)

Pretty bad overall.

### In short

Bad race for me and a bad course.  Would not run again.
