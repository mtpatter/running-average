I just finished my first half marathon, starting from no running base at all.

When I registered for the half, I had to guesstimate my projected running pace.  
I had no idea what to put in, so I registered in the 12 minute corral and hoped
that I would be able to hit that time.

I googled around to find the answer to my question- how quickly can I realistically 
and comfortably expect my running pace to improve during my training?

I couldn't find anything about pace for beginner runners- most half marathon training
references for beginners focus only on the goal of finishing.  So I thought
I would post here the exact run schedule that I actually followed and also a plot
of my pace over time to show results for an average person (no running base)
following a half marathon training schedule.

Below is the schedule of what I actually ran.  I followed the Nike+ Running coach
beginner half marathon program for a little while, but moved long runs to 
Saturdays and backed off a little more on the running
than the Nike+ coach suggested because I started to get
burnt out in the last month.  For cross-training I did 30-45 minute workouts
from the Nike+ Training coach app.  Sundays, I frequently did 45 minutes
of yoga.  I also did additional short 15 min yoga sessions pretty 
regularly (3 or 4 times per week).

### Running pace improvement

Here's a plot of my running pace.  I started really slowly at 14' pace (my excuse is that
I also ran in the snow), but I was able to get down to a 10:30' pace in the last week or 
so before the half.  My official pace for the half marathon was 10:38' for a 2:19:26 finish time.
