Here's a look back at my training runs for my second half marathon.

I did a great job vastly improving my pace while [training for my first half marathon]({{site.url}}/training/first-half-training), so I figured that if I continued with the same effort training for my second half that I'd probably beat some land speed records.  Just kidding, I know statistics- it was highly unlikely. 

### Running pace 

I was hoping though to continue to improve my pace, but I wasn't really able to.  I pretty much plateaued/slowed.  I think there were two main reasons for this.  

1. I had three weeks of crap mileage.  I was trying to follow the same Beginner level Nike+ Running coach 12-week training plan as I did the first time, but a week long work trip to Europe plus getting sick immediately after returning meant I skipped two long runs entirely and fell short by 20/22/11 miles in weeks 6/7/8 of training.

2. The heat/humidity of the summer is killing me.  So much easier to run in the cool spring.  At some point later I want to look at some plots of my running pace and temperature.
 
Below I plot my running pace over the 12 weeks of training against a few different variables.  Long runs are my Saturday "easy runs" where I don't care about my pace.  I don't do any real speed training yet so the rest are just "regular" runs.  In the top right I added to the plot an estimate of a comfortable/safe target pace for my half marathon race based on my training history.

If you're a Nike+ user and want to make similar plots for yourself using the Nike+ api, find my R source code on my [Github RunR repo](http://github.com/mtpatter/RunR).

My actual half marathon race pace overall was 11:10' for a finish time of 2:26:16.  Slower than my first half marathon in April, where I finished at 2:19:26 (10:38' pace).  If you're interested, here are recaps of those races, the [July Rock 'n Roll Chicago]({{site.url}}/race-recaps/rock-n-roll-chicago) and the [April Chi-town Half]({{site.url}}/race-recaps/chitown-half).

Looking forward to some cooler weather for my next race in September.
