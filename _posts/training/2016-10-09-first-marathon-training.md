I ran the Chicago marathon in October 2016 - my first marathon - a year and 10
months after I first started running. I had 5 half marathons, 4 ten milers,
and a few other races under my belt so I had a pretty solid running base.

I primarily used the Nike+ running coach app (now defunct I think)
marathon training program to plan out all my training runs.
It's a 20 week training program with runs 5 days per week.
A little intense compared to Hal Higdon's beginners' training program, but I
just wanted to be well prepared.

Below is the schedule of what I actually ran.
I did very little actual cross-training, just some easy yoga every once in a
while on Sundays.
Each week I show in parentheses my actual mileage / planned miles for the week,
so you can see how well (or poorly) I stuck to the plan. Days I was supposed to
run but didn't I marked with zero miles (as opposed to rest days).

I moved across the country during week 9 so I logged zero miles that week.
In week 5 / 12, I didn't run a 10k / half marathon race as suggested- just the distance.

My goal for the marathon was to finish under 4:55, and I got in with a minute to
spare at 4:53:59 or a pace of 11:13 min/mile.
