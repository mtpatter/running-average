I'm a newbie running impostor slowly becoming obsessed with my running data.

I reluctantly agreed to sign up for a half marathon after 
several mimosas at New Year's Day brunch with my good friend.  I finished it (going from 
never running more than ~2-3 miles at once and not a single mile in several years) 
and surprisingly 
didn't hate it or die at the finish line, so I've decided to try to keep up with the
running and have signed up for more races to keep me motivated.

I'll share my experience here partly to keep my own records and partly to
provide a reference and some real data about a non-athlete, average person, beginner 
distance runner (> 5k) to contribute back to the interwebs in light of my new obsession with reading running blogs and running related stats.
